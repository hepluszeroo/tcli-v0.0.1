# Terminate Leak Fix Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the changes made to fix the memory leak that occurred when repeatedly calling `terminate()` on AgentLoop instances. The leak was causing significant memory growth in long-running sessions and automated tests.

## Key Changes

### 1. Enhanced Instrumentation & Diagnostics

- Added WeakRef-based instance tracking for detecting leaked objects
- Implemented detailed logging of resource counts before and after cleanup
- Added stream listener count tracking to pinpoint reference leaks

### 2. Memory Management Improvements

- Ensured proper generation counter increments to prevent ID collisions
- Created fresh Set instances for collections rather than just clearing them
- Explicitly removed all listeners from streams using `removeAllListeners()`
- Used fresh AbortController instances to prevent listener accumulation
- Added additional nullification of instance fields to break reference cycles
- Improved callback function replacement to break closure chains

### 3. Run Method Safety 

- Added checks during stream iteration to detect if termination occurred
- Enhanced the finally block to ensure thorough cleanup of resources
- Added safety guards for error handling during cleanup operations

### 4. Documentation

- Created detailed root cause analysis document
- Added inline code comments explaining memory management techniques
- Updated method documentation with memory management strategies

## Testing Approach

The fix was validated with both unit tests and regression tests:

1. Memory growth test: 100 sequential terminations (expected < 5MB growth)
2. Concurrency test: 10 simultaneous terminations (expected < 5MB growth)
3. API invariants: ensure `run()` throws appropriate errors after termination
4. Idempotency test: multiple `terminate()` calls should be safe

## Conclusion

The terminate leak fix addresses all identified causes of memory retention in the AgentLoop termination path. By combining proper resource cleanup, reference breaking, and enhanced object lifecycle management, we ensure that terminated AgentLoop instances can be properly garbage collected.

These changes build on the foundations established by the cancel-path leak fix, extending them to address the specific challenges of permanent instance termination.

## Future Work

- Consider adding periodic GC triggering for long-running sessions
- Add memory monitoring for continuous integration to catch regressions
- Implement more aggressive stream cleanup on Node.js 18+ with optional FinalizationRegistry
