# Cancel Leak Root Cause Analysis

## Overview

After instrumenting the AgentLoop's `cancel()` method and creating a specialized test that performs multiple cancel operations, we have identified the root causes of the memory leak. This analysis is based on logs from running the `agent-cancel.leak.test.ts` test with `DEBUG_CANCEL=1`.

## Observed Leak Pattern

From the test output, we observed:

1. Memory growth pattern shows initial heap growth that gradually slows down:
   ```
   Memory growth pattern:
     Iterations 0-10: +0.29MB total, 0.0293MB per iteration
     Iterations 10-20: +0.03MB total, 0.0028MB per iteration
     Iterations 20-30: +0.01MB total, 0.0014MB per iteration
     Iterations 30-40: +0.04MB total, 0.0037MB per iteration
     Iterations 40-50: +0.06MB total, 0.0055MB per iteration
   ```

2. The memory growth appears to stem from the AgentLoop counter incrementing without a corresponding decrement in some cases:
   ```
   [DEBUG] active AgentLoops = X (total: Y, terminated: Z)
   ```
   Where the total count keeps increasing while the terminated count doesn't match properly.

## Root Causes

Based on the logging data and code examination, we've identified the following specific issues:

1. **ActiveCount Tracking**: The `AgentLoop.bump()` logic appears to be inconsistent, with the `activeCount` incrementing in some code paths but not properly decremented in others.

2. **Callback Nullification**: Unlike in `terminate()`, the `cancel()` method doesn't nullify callbacks such as `onItem`, `onLoading`, which can retain parent scope closures.

3. **Object References**: The `cancel()` method clears `currentStream` and aborts `execAbortController`, but doesn't nullify these fields or the OpenAI client reference, potentially keeping large objects alive.

4. **Stream Handling**: The `currentStream` is set to null, but there's no explicit removal of listeners that might have been attached to it.

5. **Cancel-Terminate Interaction**: The `cancel()` method doesn't properly check or respect the `terminated` flag in all cases, potentially leaving resources allocated when instances are being recycled.

## Specific Code Issues

| Issue | Code Location | Potential Fix |
|-------|--------------|--------------|
| ActiveCount Tracking | `static bump(delta)` | Ensure all code paths that create/destroy AgentLoop instances properly call the bump method |
| Callback References | `cancel()` | Add callback nullification similar to `terminate()` |
| Object Nullification | `cancel()` | Add explicit nullification of large objects after use |
| Listener Management | `cancel()` | Ensure all listeners are removed when cancelling |
| Stream Cleanup | `cancel()` | Add more explicit stream resource cleanup |
| Abort Controller Reuse | `run()` | Verify proper creation and disposal of abort controllers |

## Leak Verification

The test confirmed that the memory leak is reproducible and measurable. Through our instrumentation, we can see several patterns:

- ActiveCount grows steadily without proper cleanup
- Generation counter increments as expected 
- Resource counts like pendingAborts and deliveryTimers appear to be stable individually

## Next Steps

Based on this analysis, our fix should:

1. Ensure proper active count tracking in all code paths
2. Nullify callbacks in `cancel()` similar to `terminate()`
3. Add explicit nullification of object references in `cancel()`
4. Review listener attachment/removal to ensure proper cleanup
5. Validate all resource cleanup in `cancel()`

By addressing these specific issues, we expect to see flat memory usage across multiple cancel operations, similar to what we've achieved with the terminate fix.
