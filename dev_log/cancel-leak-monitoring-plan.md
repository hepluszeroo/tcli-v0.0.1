# Cancel Leak Fix Monitoring Plan

## Duration: 1 week after merge

## Monitoring Tasks:

1. **Daily CI Check**:
   - Check the CI logs for memory usage patterns
   - Verify DEBUG_CANCEL diagnostic logs show zero counters for:
     - pendingAborts
     - abortListeners
     - deliveryTimers
   - Look for any MaxListenersExceededWarning or OOM errors

2. **Memory Metrics to Track**:
   - Heap before/after test execution
   - Listener counts (especially for 'abort' events)
   - Any growth patterns in collections

3. **Scheduled Check-ins**:
   - Day 3: Mid-week check
   - Day 7: Final assessment

## Success Criteria:
- No OOM errors in CI
- Flat memory usage across tests
- Zero counter metrics in DEBUG_CANCEL logs
- No warnings or errors related to resource leaks

## Action Items:
- If issues observed, revert to single-thread mode until fixed
- Document findings for future reference
- Apply learnings to the upcoming terminate-leak fix

## Next Steps after Successful Monitoring:
- Remove DEBUG_CANCEL logs (or keep guarded for future diagnostics)
- Transition to terminate-leak fix implementation
- Update project documentation on memory management

## Tentative Timeline:
- Monitoring Start: [Merge Date]
- Mid-check: [Merge Date + 3 days]
- Final Assessment: [Merge Date + 7 days]
- Close Issue: [Merge Date + 8 days]
