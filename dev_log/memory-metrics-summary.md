# Memory Metrics Summary for Cancel Leak Fix

## Standalone Test Results (agent-cancel-debug.ts with 50 iterations)

```
Initial memory: {
  rss: 29474816,
  heapTotal: 5029888,
  heapUsed: 3482904,
  external: 1240441,
  arrayBuffers: 10515
}

Final memory: {
  rss: 29540352,
  heapTotal: 5029888,
  heapUsed: 3482904,
  external: 1240441,
  arrayBuffers: 10515
}
```

### Key Metrics:
- **Memory Delta**: 0.00 MB (no change in heapUsed)
- **DEBUG_CANCEL metrics**: All counters consistently show:
  - pendingAborts=0
  - abortListeners=0
  - deliveryTimers=0

## Regression Test Results (agent-cancel.leak.test.ts with 10 iterations)

```
Initial heap: 10.69 MB
Final heap: 10.87 MB
Delta: 0.18 MB
```

### Key Metrics:
- **Memory Delta**: 0.18 MB (well under 5MB limit)
- **Test Duration**: ~121ms (fast and reliable)

## Before Fix vs. After Fix Comparison

### Before Fix:
- Memory would grow unbounded with each cancel operation
- Listeners would accumulate on AbortSignal
- Reaching maximum listeners warning after multiple operations
- Eventually causing OOM errors in CI

### After Fix:
- Flat memory profile even after 50+ cancel operations
- All resources properly cleaned up
- Zero residual counters
- Tests pass consistently in both standalone and test environments

## Memory Analysis Technique
Each test run included:
1. Initial memory measurement
2. Multiple cancel operations (10-50)
3. Final memory measurement
4. GC forced between measurements to ensure accurate readings
