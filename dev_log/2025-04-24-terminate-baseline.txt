# Terminate leak baseline (50x iterations)
# Command: DEBUG_TERMINATE=1 DEBUG_CANCEL=1 node --expose-gc node_modules/.bin/vitest run tests/agent-terminate.leak.test.ts --run 50

Initial heap measurements:
- Initial heap: 10.73 MB
- Initial warning listeners: 1

After 50 terminate cycles:
- Final heap: 11.08 MB 
- Final warning listeners: 1
- Delta: 0.35 MB

Test result: PASS

# Observations

With enhanced logging, we can see:

1. Memory growth is minimal (0.35 MB after 50 iterations), well below our 5 MB threshold
2. AgentLoop count properly increments and decrements, but we see a pattern where it reaches 51 at the end (1 higher than expected)
3. DEBUG_TERMINATE logs show:
   - pendingAborts, abortListeners, hardAbortListeners, deliveryTimers all consistently 0 before and after cleanup
   - No apparent resource accumulation in the terminate flow
4. Suspicious logs show agent generation always = 1, suggesting we might need to check if generation counter is being reset properly

# Next Steps for Phase 1/2 - Instrumentation & Root Cause Analysis

1. Further investigate the AgentLoop counter (why we end with 51 instead of 50)
2. Check if the currentStream or hardAbort.signal are being properly cleaned up
3. Test with more consecutive runs to see if a small memory growth accumulates over time
4. Conduct a more detailed codebase review of the `terminate()` method to identify any potential areas for optimization

Despite the minimal memory leak, there appears to be a discrepancy with the instance counting that could be affecting GC of AgentLoop instances. The 0.35 MB growth over 50 instances suggests some objects are being retained.
