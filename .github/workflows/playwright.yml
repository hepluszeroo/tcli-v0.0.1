      # Build the Docker image that contains all Playwright test dependencies.
      #
      # IMPORTANT: We pass a CACHE_BUST build-arg derived from the current
      # commit SHA so the CI runner never re-uses a stale cached layer that may
      # pre-date the latest Electron installation fixes.  Without this the
      # runner could use an older cached layer which is missing the manually
      # downloaded Electron ELF binary, causing the subsequent verification
      # step inside the container to report:
      #   /repo/bin/electron: symbolic link to /repo/node_modules/electron/dist/electron
      #   ‚ùå Electron binary is NOT an ELF executable!
      #
      # Using the SHA as a cache-buster guarantees that every CI run builds
      # the layers that install the correct Electron binary and run the final
      # verification checks we added in Dockerfile.playwright.
